SORADSIM

Space Object Radar Simulator

Author: Ashiv Rao Dhondea. ashivdhondea5[at]gmail.com
Created: 16 August 2017

This is a Python-based space object dynamics simulator aiming to help in 
designing ground-based radar systems for space debris studies.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #
Most of the libraries required to be able to run the codes here were built by the
author, Ashiv Dhondea, during 2016 and 2017 while doing his master's project on
space debris tracking for the MeerKAT bistatic radar at the University of Cape 
Town's Radar Remote Sensing Group.
