# SORADSIM
Space Object RADar SIMulator

This is a Python-based space object dynamics simulator aiming to help in designing ground-based radar systems for space debris studies.

## Mission Planning Tool for Space Debris Studies with the MeerKAT Radar
I developed SORADSIM while working in the [Radar Remote Sensing Group](http://www.rrsg.uct.ac.za/) at the University of Cape Town. The master's dissertation [Mission Planning Tool for Space Debris Studies with the MeerKAT radar](https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/29617) presents the results created by the simulation scripts in this repo. These results were also published in a [conference paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8835735) presented at the 2019 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf) in Boston, USA. The source files for the conference paper are in a [public repo](https://github.com/AshivDhondea/ashiv_2019_radar_conf).

### Prerequisites
SORADSIM was developed in Python 2.7, but it will run in Python 3 with minimal effort.
Python libraries required:
| numpy |
| math |
| scipy |
| matplotlib + basemap|
| pandas|
| datetime |
| pytz |
| aniso8601 |
